10. **Top Picks** -> How "Top Picks" Are Managed
    There are two ways to determine which products appear in the "Top Picks" section:

    ‚úîÔ∏è Automatic: Based on Popularity
    A background job updates the ranking score using:
    
    - Number of orders in the last X days
    - User likes or favorites
    - Click-through rates on the product page
    - Recent purchase trends
    
    ‚úîÔ∏è Manual: Admin Marks a Product
    - Admins can manually add or remove products from "Top Picks" using the Admin Panel.
